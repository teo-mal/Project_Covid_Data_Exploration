/*
Here is the breakdown:

Most locations have much lower average ICU admission rates, ranging from 0.119% to 0.612%.
This is within a normal range for ICU admissions relative to the total number of COVID-19 cases reported.
Many of the top locations with higher ICU admission rates are European countries, including Italy, Slovakia, Belgium, Slovenia, and others.
This might reflect regional healthcare systems, the impact of COVID-19 waves, or data reporting practices in these countries.
Non-European countries like Chile, Argentina, and South Africa also appear in the list,
but their rates are much lower compared to the peak value observed.

Explaining Franceâ€™s High Rate:
The figure of 1482.439% is extraordinarily high and suggests that there may be a data error.
ICU admission rates are typically calculated as a percentage of total cases, so a rate above 100% indicates that
either the data has been misreported or that there is an issue with how ICU cases and total cases are recorded.
